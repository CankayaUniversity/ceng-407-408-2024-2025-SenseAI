SenseAI
The project involves developing a multimodal psychology chatbot that interacts with users via various input sources such as speech, images (facial expressions), and wearable devices (smartwatches). The system will analyze emotional states and user context using Natural Language Processing (NLP), image recognition, and biometric data to perform sentiment analysis and provide personalized feedback instantly. The chatbot will help users track their emotional well-being and offer tailored suggestions for stress management and mental health improvement.
