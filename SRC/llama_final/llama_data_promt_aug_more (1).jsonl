{"input": "Emotion: fear.I keep thinking about what will happen after I die. The idea of not existing anymore is too much to handle.", "output": "I can feel how intense this fear is for you. The thought of death can make the world feel uncertain, even unreal, like everything around you is fragile. These thoughts can be paralyzing, but they're also a reflection of how deeply you want to live, to feel safe, to stay connected.

But I want you to know—many people experience this, and it doesn't make you strange or wrong. It makes you human.

{"input": "Emotion: fear.No matter how much I try to stay healthy or safe, I know I'll die eventually—and that thought haunts me.", "output": "Sometimes the fear of death isn't just about dying—it's about leaving things undone, losing people we love, or not having control over our lives.

{"input": "Emotion: anger.I'm terrified of trying and failing. What if I put in all this effort and still end up with nothing?", "output": "It's completely natural to worry about failure, especially when you care deeply about your goals and the people around you. But remember, fear of failure often comes from high expectations — and that usually means you have strong values and aspirations, which is a strength, not a weakness."}
{"input": "Emotion: sad.Sometimes I feel like no matter what I do, it won't be good enough.", "output": "Let's take a moment to explore where these expectations come from and whether they're fair or realistic. Failure, when it happens, is not the end — it's often a stepping stone. We'll work together to redefine what success means for you, not based on others' standards, but on your own values. You're allowed to grow at your own pace, and perfection isn't the goal — progress is."}
{"input": "Emotion: anger.I keep procrastinating because I'm afraid that if I try, people will see I'm not as capable as they think.", "output": "I understand that the fear of failure can feel paralyzing.

No one succeeds without facing challenges, and mistakes don't define your worth—they're part of the growth process"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I'm scared that I peaked already and it's all downhill from here.", "output": "The fear of failure often feels like it's looming over everything we do, like every step we take is weighed with judgment.

{"input": "Emotion: sad.Whenever I imagine my future, all I can see are the ways it could go wrong.", "output": "When you're afraid of failing, it can feel like you're constantly walking on eggshells, as if every decision carries the weight of your future. But it's okay to make mistakes. They don't erase your value. They simply give you new perspectives, new ways to learn about yourself and what matters to you"}
{"input": "Emotion: neutral.I don't want to risk failing, so I avoid going after what I really want.", "output": "The pressure to succeed can sometimes make you feel like there's no room for error, but that's not true. Every successful person has faced failure, whether publicly or privately. What matters isn't whether you fail—it's how you rise after the fall, and you have the strength to do that, too"}
{"input": "Emotion: sad.Even when I do well, I feel like it's not enough — like I should've done better.", "output": "I hear that you're afraid of failing, and that's understandable. Failure can feel like a loss, like a reflection of your abilities. But that fear is just an emotion, not a fact. It's okay to not be perfect. You don't have to carry the weight of success alone, and it's okay to take things one step at a time"}
{"input": "Emotion: sad.I feel like one failure will define me forever.", "output": "It can feel like failure is the end of everything you've worked for, but it's not. Failure is just feedback—it shows us where we can improve, what we can try differently. The fear of failing is a natural response, but it doesn't have to stop you from moving forward. Your journey is about progress, not perfection"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.People believe in me, but I'm scared I can't live up to their expectations.", "output": "Fear of failure can sometimes cause us to freeze, to hesitate in taking the next step. But I want you to know, it's okay to take small steps. You don't have to leap forward all at once. Each small move is progress, and it's better to move at your own pace than not move at all"}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.I envy others who seem so confident about their goals. I can't stop doubting myself.", "output": "It's natural to fear failure when so much is at stake, but failure isn't the end—it's often the beginning of a new path. Don't let the fear of what might happen keep you from trying. You're allowed to make mistakes, learn, and grow. That's the only way we truly move forward."}
{"input": "Emotion: anger.What if I put everything into this and it still doesn't work out?", "output": "Success isn't about never failing—it's about continuing to try, even after setbacks. You don't have to achieve everything perfectly the first time around. The most important thing is that you keep moving, even when things don't go as planned. I believe in your ability to rise again"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I worry that I'm wasting time chasing something I'm not even capable of achieving.", "output": "Success is often seen as the absence of failure, but that's not the full picture. Failure is a part of the journey, and it teaches us more than success ever could. You don't need to fear failure—you only need to fear giving up, and I can tell you're not someone who will give up"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.Sometimes when I'm walking alone, I feel like someone is watching me, even if no one's around.", "output": "Sometimes, we can feel unsafe or like we're being watched, especially when we're alone or under stress. These feelings can arise as a way for our mind to protect us, even though the threat might not actually be there. When you feel like you're being followed or watched, what thoughts come to mind? Do certain sounds or movements make you feel more anxious?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I hear footsteps behind me, but when I turn around, there's nothing there. It really scares me.", "output": "When we hear a sound, especially in a quiet or unfamiliar place, it can easily trigger our minds to jump to conclusions. These moments can feel overwhelming, and it's natural to want to check for safety. When you notice these sounds, how do you usually react? Do you feel comforted once you find there's no one there, or does it stay with you?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.Even at home, I sometimes feel like there's someone hiding or watching me through the window.", "output": "It's completely normal to feel unsettled when we hear noises or see things that seem out of place. But sometimes, our minds are more sensitive to our environment when we're feeling anxious or stressed. When you feel like someone might be behind you or following you, do you think about the situation differently once you pause and take a breath?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I get really jumpy when I hear small noises, like a creak or a knock. It instantly puts me on edge.", "output": "Hearing footsteps or noticing movement when no one is around can be disorienting, especially when you're alone. Our minds are good at picking up on sounds, even small ones, and sometimes they can create a sense of danger when none exists. When you're in these situations, how do you calm yourself? What helps you reassure yourself that you're safe?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.It's like I'm always on high alert. Every little sound makes me think something bad is about to happen.", "output": "Feeling like someone is watching you or that there are unseen threats around can be especially intense in quiet or isolated moments. These thoughts can be more frequent when we're stressed. When you experience these feelings, do you notice any patterns or situations that make them stronger? How do you normally handle them in those moments?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.When I'm alone at night, even a gust of wind or a shadow makes me panic, like someone is trying to get in.", "output": "Sometimes, feeling like you're being followed or noticing strange noises can be our minds' way of heightening awareness in a stressful situation. It's not uncommon to feel uneasy during these times. Have you found any ways to remind yourself of your safety or bring your attention back to the present moment when you feel these things?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.There are times I feel like I can sense a presence near me, but I know logically no one's there.", "output": "It's natural to be cautious when something feels off, but constant alertness can also make us feel more anxious. When you hear sounds or feel like you're being watched, have you noticed any ways to soothe yourself? Perhaps grounding exercises or focusing on your immediate surroundings?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I constantly check over my shoulder when I walk. I feel like someone is trailing me or watching my every move.", "output": "These moments of feeling watched or hearing things can sometimes be a result of our minds working overtime in response to stress. It doesn't mean there's a real danger—it's more about how our bodies and minds are reacting. When you notice these feelings, how do you typically manage them in the moment?

It's okay to acknowledge how much that impacted you — it reflects how important honesty and sincerity are to you."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Hearing him brag about hurting others made me feel sick inside", "output": "That reaction makes a lot of sense.

Feeling sickened shows your strong moral compass and how much you value kindness and compassion toward others."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.When she betrayed my trust for the second time, I felt an overwhelming sense of disgust", "output": "Repeated betrayal can cut even deeper than the first time because it reinforces the feeling that your boundaries and trust were not respected. That sense of disgust is a protective response — your mind and body recognizing a violation of emotional safety."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Watching him manipulate his friends for personal gain left me speechless and repulsed.", "output": "Seeing someone use others for their own benefit can shake your faith in relationships. That feeling of being speechless and repulsed is a sign that your values — like loyalty and fairness — were deeply violated. It's okay to take time to process those emotions."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Listening to her brag about getting a waiter fired over a minor mistake is gross.", "output": "It's natural to feel disturbed when someone takes pride in punishing others over small errors.

{"input": "Emotion: anger.He mocked a disabled customer behind their back like it was hilarious.He make me wanna", "output": "That kind of behavior is truly hurtful and dehumanizing. It's understandable that it triggered such a strong emotional and even physical reaction in you. Your response shows that you deeply care about dignity, respect, and standing up for those who are vulnerable."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.When I found out he had spread rumors about me, I couldn't even look at him without feeling nauseated", "output": "Having your reputation damaged by someone you may have trusted is incredibly painful. That nausea reflects the betrayal and violation of your social and emotional safety. It's okay to feel hurt — you're allowed to protect yourself emotionally from that kind of harm."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.She smiled to my face and insulted me behind my back, which made me lose all respect for her", "output": "That kind of two-faced behavior can be jarring and disorienting. Losing respect in such a situation is natural — it's your internal boundaries reacting to dishonesty and emotional duplicity. You deserve relationships built on trust and integrity."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Watching someone bully a defenseless person stirred a deep revulsion in me", "output": "That deep revulsion is a very human and empathetic response. Witnessing cruelty, especially toward someone who can't defend themselves, often activates our most protective instincts. It speaks volumes about your sense of justice and your emotional sensitivity."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.The way he laughed about lying to his family made my skin crawl", "output": "Hearing someone dismiss the pain of others — especially family — can be incredibly disturbing. That crawling feeling might come from your instinctive discomfort with deceit and your values around emotional honesty and accountability."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Hearing her casually joke about other people's misfortunes made me sick", "output": "Joking about suffering can feel cold and heartless, especially when it's done casually. Your reaction is a sign of your emotional depth — that you recognize pain, even in others, and don't take it lightly. That's a strength, not a weakness."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.I saw him flirt with someone while still pretending to be loyal to his partner, and it disgusted me", "output": "Witnessing disloyalty can be deeply unsettling, especially if you value integrity and honesty in relationships. That sense of disgust might come from a place of protectiveness — whether for the partner or for the standards you hold in close connections."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.The selfish way she treated her parents when they needed her support left me disgusted", "output": "It can be painful to see someone neglect the people who cared for them, especially in times of need. Your emotional response shows how much you value gratitude, empathy, and mutual support in family relationships."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Seeing someone mock a disabled person filled me with absolute disgust", "output": "That response is completely understandable. When we witness cruelty toward those who are already facing challenges, it can provoke a powerful emotional response. It shows your strong sense of justice and your capacity to empathize with the marginalized."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.He made jokes about serious issues without any empathy, which made me feel sick inside", "output": "When people are dismissive or even mocking about serious or painful matters, it can feel invalidating and emotionally jarring. Your reaction reveals how much you care about sensitivity, and it's okay to feel affected by that kind of insensitivity."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Seeing someone exploit an elderly person for money was deeply disgusting", "output": "Exploitation of vulnerable individuals — especially elders — strikes a nerve for many people. Your disgust shows that you have a strong moral core and a natural desire to protect and advocate for those who may be at risk of being taken advantage of."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.She manipulated the situation so coldly that it left a bitter taste in my mouth", "output": "Manipulation, especially when done with calculated indifference, can be emotionally jarring. That bitter feeling is your emotional system recognizing something harmful and unjust. It's okay to feel shaken when someone shows such a lack of empathy."}
{"input": "Emotion: disgust.Listening to him boast about using others made me feel slimy just being around him", "output": "Feeling slimy or uncomfortable in someone's presence after hearing them boast about manipulation is a valid gut reaction. It's your body and mind signaling that their values are in conflict with yours — and that you may need to protect your emotional boundaries."}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I'm terrified of the future. I don't know what's going to happen, and the uncertainty makes me feel completely out of control. I keep imagining worst-case scenarios, and it's exhausting.", "output": "It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the unknown, and that's an incredibly difficult place to be. When the future feels uncertain, our minds often try to protect us by imagining every possible outcome — but unfortunately, that often leads to more anxiety, not less."}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I keep thinking about the future, and it's really overwhelming. I don't know how things will turn out, and it scares me.", "output": "I hear that the uncertainty of the future is causing you a lot of anxiety. It's completely understandable to feel that way, especially when there are so many unknowns ahead. What specifically about the future worries you the most?"}

What are some moments in the past when you've managed challenges well, despite fear?"}
{"input": "Emotion: anger.What if I make the wrong decisions in life and mess everything up? I can't stop worrying about it.", "output": "It seems like you're feeling a lot of pressure to make the 'right' choices. But the reality is that there's rarely one perfect decision. Even when we make mistakes, we learn from them and grow. What's one decision you've made in the past that turned out well, even if it wasn't perfect?"}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.I don't know what the future holds, and that uncertainty is terrifying. What if I don't get what I want?", "output": "What you're experiencing is a very human reaction to unpredictability. Many people feel afraid when they can't see what's coming next. It's okay to feel scared — it doesn't mean you're weak or broken."}
{"input": "Emotion: fear.What if I don't succeed in the future? I'm afraid I'll waste all my time and end up with nothing.", "output": "It's natural to feel uneasy when the future feels unclear. We often don't know exactly how things will unfold, and that can create a sense of fear. But sometimes, the uncertainty allows room for unexpected opportunities. Have you ever experienced a situation where something you didn't plan for turned out to be good?"}
{"input": "Emotion: anger.I get angry so easily, even over small things. It's like I can't control it.", "output": "It sounds like your anger comes on suddenly and feels overwhelming. Sometimes, we feel out of control when emotions like anger take over. Let's explore what triggers these feelings and see if we can find ways to manage them better."}

{"input": "Emotion: anger.I've been really angry at someone close to me for a long time, and it's hard to let it go.", "output": "It can be really painful to hold on to anger, especially when it's tied to someone you care about. Holding on to that anger often means there's something unresolved. Let's explore what it is that makes it so hard to move past these feelings."}
{"input": "Emotion: anger.Sometimes, I feel like my anger is all I have left. It's like a shield to protect me from feeling vulnerable.", "output": "The key is not to suppress anger, but to acknowledge it and express it in healthy ways. Can you think of any situations where you were able to express your anger more calmly?"}
{"input": "Emotion: anger.I don't know how to stop being so angry at the world.
